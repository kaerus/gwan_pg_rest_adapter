# PostgreSQL g-wan REST adapter

REST API for postgres

The REST API runs as a servlet in the [g-wan](http://g-wan.com) web/application server.

Written in C for speed, profit and fun. ;)

Featuring documents, collections, graphs and a SQL query API.

## Type of applications
What can be done with it?

* Interface your web application directly with postgres
